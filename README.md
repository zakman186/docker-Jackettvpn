## Docker Features
* Base: Debian bullseye-slim
* Latest [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett)
* Selectively enable or disable WireGuard or OpenVPN support
* IP tables kill switch to prevent IP leaking when VPN connection fails
* Configurable UID and GID for config files and /blackhole for Jackett
* Created with [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) in mind

# Run container from Docker registry
The container is available from the Docker Hub, which is the simplest way to get it.
To run the container use this command, with additional parameters, please refer to the Variables, Volumes, and Ports section:

```
$ docker run --privileged  -d \
              -v /your/config/path/:/config \
              -v /your/downloads/path/:/blackhole \
              -e "VPN_ENABLED=yes" \
              -e "VPN_TYPE=wireguard" \
              -e "LAN_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/24" \
              -p 9117:9117 \
              --restart unless-stopped \

# How to use WireGuard 
The container will fail to boot if `VPN_ENABLED` is set and there is no valid .conf file present in the /config/wireguard directory. Drop a .conf file from your VPN provider into /config/wireguard and start the container again. The file must have the name `wg0.conf`, or it will fail to start.

# How to use OpenVPN
The container will fail to boot if `VPN_ENABLED` is set and there is no valid .ovpn file present in the /config/openvpn directory. Drop a .ovpn file from your VPN provider into /config/openvpn (if necessary with additional files like certificates) and start the container again. You may need to edit the ovpn configuration file to load your VPN credentials from a file by setting `auth-user-pass`.

**Note:** The script will use the first ovpn file it finds in the /config/openvpn directory. Adding multiple ovpn files will not start multiple VPN connections.

## Example auth-user-pass option for .ovpn files
`auth-user-pass credentials.conf`

## Example credentials.conf
```
username
password
```

## PUID/PGID
User ID (PUID) and Group ID (PGID) can be found by issuing the following command for the user you want to run the container as:

```
id <username>
```
